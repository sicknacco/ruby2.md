# Workflow practice!

This will be my Initial commit

# First of a few changes

Here are some **changes**

## Some more changes

Oh look! Some more changes!

# Even more changes!

I think I should push after this next commit . . . .

# Start of second batch to push

Whoops, I should have pushed my Initial commit. Now it seems only my second commit was pushed.

# Glad this is practice

Okay, I'm going to add, commit, and push again. . .

# Lets add some more first

I hope no one reads this. . .
